DESCRIPTION:

MySQL Database Backup and Restore Process

1. Backup Process
   
The backup process creates a copy of the database in the form of an SQL file, which can be used later to restore the database.
The backup file contains the database structure, table data, indexes, and constraints.
mysqldump is commonly used to export the database to a .sql file.
The backup file is typically stored in a designated backup folder for safekeeping.

2. Restore Process
The restore process takes the backup file and imports it into MySQL.
The data is not stored as a separate file but is directly inserted into the MySQL database.
The restoration process reconstructs tables, relationships, and data from the backup file.
The mysql command-line tool is used to read and execute SQL statements from the backup file.
